						<h2>Space Telescopes: Windows to the Cosmos</h2>
						<p>
							Space telescopes, orbiting outside Earth's atmosphere, provide
							clear, uninterrupted views of the universe. They have
							revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos, from the detailed
							study of planets, stars, galaxies, to exploring the mysteries of
							dark matter and dark energy.

						<h3>The Hubble Space Telescope: A Trailblazer</h3>
						<p>
							Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has become a
							cornerstone of astronomical research. Orbiting Earth, it has an
							unobstructed view of the universe and has made over 1.5 million
							observations, including deep field images that have provided a
							look back over 13 billion years.
						</p>

						<h3>Discoveries by Hubble</h3>
						<p>
							Hubble's observations have led to breakthroughs like the precise
							measurement of the universe's expansion rate, the discovery of the
							accelerating expansion (implying the presence of dark energy), and
							breathtaking images of distant galaxies and nebulae.
						</p>

						<h3>James Webb Space Telescope: A New Era</h3>
						<p>
							The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, represents the
							next leap in space observatories. With a larger mirror and
							advanced instruments, it is poised to uncover secrets of the early
							universe and provide unprecedented insights into exoplanet
							atmospheres.

						<h3>Key Discoveries by JWST</h3>
						<p>
							JWST's early observations have already made significant
							contributions, including capturing the first direct image of an
							exoplanet and analyzing the atmospheric composition of exoplanets,
							hinting at the potential for life beyond our solar system.
						</p>

						<h3>Challenging the Big Bang Model</h3>
						<p>
							The JWST's deep observations of the early universe are providing
							new insights that may lead to a revised understanding of
							cosmological theories. It's poised to offer clues about the
							earliest stages of the universe, potentially reshaping our
							comprehension of the Big Bang.
						</p>

						<h3>Future of Observational Technology</h3>
						<p>
							The next generation of telescopes, such as the Nancy Grace Roman
							Space Telescope and the proposed successors to Hubble, are
							expected to further our exploration of dark matter, dark energy,
							and exoplanets. These future missions aim to deepen our
							understanding of the universe's composition and evolution.
